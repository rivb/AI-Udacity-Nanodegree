# Sudoku Project

In this project I was encourage too create a Sudoku Solver.
The importance of constraint and eliminating useless option of numbers cause by this constraint are an important thing to take in consideration for this project. Also, it is neccesary to change the box numbers so we can update the boxes of the Sudoku so we can start solving it.
Normal sudoku it have 3 contraints that consider columns, row and (3 x 3) boxes. In the last project, we add a 4th constraint that was diagonals.


Variables : 81 boxes ( 9 x 9 grid )
Domains : (1-9)
Constraints : (3 x 3), columns, rows and diagonals can not repeat the number that is set in the box with respect to the domain.
